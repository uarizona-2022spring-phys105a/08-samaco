## Assignment 08: Numerical integrator

In this assignment, you are going to reuse the numerical integrators we
implemented in
[lecture 7](https://github.com/uarizona-2022spring-phys105a/phys105a/blob/main/07/Integration.ipynb)
to compute `pi`.

It is interest to note that the convergent rates of the integration do
not match the theoretical one.
In this assignment, you will try to improve the numerical integrators
to make them converge faster.
